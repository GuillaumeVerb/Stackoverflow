## Project Motivation
This project (Write a Data Science Blog Post) is part of Udacity Data Scientists Nanodegree Program.

I have chosen to take two years to have more stable results that allow us to reach better conclusions.

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2019 & 2002 to better understand:

    1. Is there a link between salary and job satisfaction?
    2. What language and type of development to choose for a greater satisfaction?
    3. What language and type of development to choose for a better pay?
    4. Does starting to code young lead to a better career?
    5. Is it money or satisfaction that sets North America apart from other parts of the world?
